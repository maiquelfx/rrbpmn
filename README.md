## 📄 Abstract
Business Process Management (BPM) demands formalized models, yet manual BPMN construction remains labor-intensive. Large Language Models (LLMs) present opportunities for automated text-to-model translation. This **Rapid Review** synthesizes 11 empirical investigations published from 2023 to 2025.

Our analysis uncovers critical structural deficiencies: LLMs demonstrate fundamental incapacity for graph-theoretic reasoning required for valid BPMN layouts (Diagram Interchange). Specifically, **55% of surveyed approaches fail with non-trivial process complexity**, while **64% lack reproducible artifacts**. We conclude that current approaches conflate linguistic pattern matching with algorithmic reasoning, necessitating hybrid architectures.
